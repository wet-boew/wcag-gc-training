title: SC 2.4.13 Page Break Navigation
---

<h2><code>.pg-brk-aft</code></h2>

<p>The purpose of this class is to force a page break on print view right after the element on which it's applied. In order to successfully encounter WCAG 2.2 success creteria on page break navigation (SC-2.4.13), users must have a way to locate page breaks via page break locators.</p>

<h3>Page break locators</h3>

<p>When applying this class, the next element on the page must have a unique id and a way to navigate to it such as an anchor link.</p>

<h3>Working Examples</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href="page-break-fail.html">Page Break After - Pass</a></li>
	<li><a href="page-break-pass.html">Page Break After - Fail</a></li>
</ul>
